Tomato
======

Tomato is a library for emulating a DCPU-16.  Also included is Lettuce, which is a GUI front-end for Tomato.

The easiest way to use Tomato is to run Lettuce.exe, which will then prompt you to select your hardware configuration
and select a binary file to load.  You can also launch Lettuce with the command line, and completely configure the
session through command line arguments.

I'll document it more when it's more mature.
